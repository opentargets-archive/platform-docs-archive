**Important update - May 2021:**

With the launch of the [next-generation Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org/) in April 2021, we have deprecated our REST API in favour of a [new ways of accessing our data](https://platform-docs.opentargets.org/data-access) through a GraphQL API, Google BigQuery, and more comprehensive dataset downloads. 

For examples of the different ways that you can access our data — including sample scripts and outputs — please read [our data access documentation](https://platform-docs.opentargets.org/data-access) and join the [Open Targets Community](https://community.opentargets.org/). ****
{% endhint %}

Here we include a list of tutorials for programmatic access of the Open Targets Platform data.

You will be using either the Python client or accessing the Open Targets Platform REST API directly.

If you want to suggest new tutorials or new use cases for our REST API or Python client, please [email us](mailto:support@targevalidation.org).
