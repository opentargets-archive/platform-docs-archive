# RNA expression

This data type contains information on gene expression patterns under different biological conditions, such as disease and healthy tissue comparisons.

## Expression Atlas

The EMBL-EBI [Expression Atlas](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gxa/home) provides information on genes that are differentially expressed. They report the changes on the levels of gene expression between normal and disease samples, or among disease samples from different studies. 

In addition to differential expression, Expression Atlas also provides baseline expression information for every single gene in the Open Targets Platform. This is available in the page containing the target profile annotations.
