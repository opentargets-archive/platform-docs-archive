# Text search

The search box is available on the [Open Targets Platform](https://www.targetvalidation.org/) homepage and at the top of every other page.

You can search for a disease name, a gene name \(or official symbol\) or a protein name \(or symbol\). You can also search for synonyms and abbreviations for both genes \(e.g. [p53](https://www.targetvalidation.org/search?src=q:p53)\) and diseases \(e.g. [IBD](https://www.targetvalidation.org/search?src=q:IBD,p:1,f:disease) for inflammatory bowel disease\), provided these alternative names are listed in the original sources from which we get this data from, e.g. HGNC \(for genes\) and Experimental Factor Ontology \(for diseases and phenotypes\).

We also match targets and diseases to two additional entry points, phenotypes and drugs, such as [humira](https://www.targetvalidation.org/search?src=q:humira).
