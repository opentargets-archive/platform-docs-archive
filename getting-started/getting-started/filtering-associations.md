# Filtering associations

You can filter the associations based on the following categories:

* Data types, e.g. Genetic Associations, Somatic mutations, Drugs
* Therapeutic area, e.g. Genetic disorder, Eye disease
* Pathway types, e.g. Signal Transduction, Cell Cycle
* Target class, e.g. Enzyme, Ion channel

Each of those can be further filtered, e.g. you can select the GWAS catalog data under Genetic Associations.
