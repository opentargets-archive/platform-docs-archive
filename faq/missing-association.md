# Why can't I find a known association?

If we miss known associations that are described elsewhere, please [get in touch](mailto:support@targetvalidation.org?). The reasons can be severalfold and we will look at the examples on a case-by-case basis. If the known association is described in a recent paper, it will not have made it through the curation process within our data sources yet. If the known association is based on a variant with an ID \(e.g. rs123, His166Tyr\), please include that information as well. We are revisiting our variant-to-gene assignment to assess if eQTLs could give a more likely assignment that the one we currently use, which is based on functional data only as described in ["How does Open Target assign variants \(e.g. SNPs\) to genes?"](http://www.targetvalidation.org/#variants). By providing this information, you can help us improve our analyses for variant-to-gene assignment.
