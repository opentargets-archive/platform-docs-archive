# How do you distinguish variants from mutations?

Variants are base differences observed in the human population \(e.g. 1000 Genomes, gnomAD\), whereas mutations are base changes that have been associated with a significant phenotypic change. Changes associated with a rare disease or cancer are referred as mutations.
