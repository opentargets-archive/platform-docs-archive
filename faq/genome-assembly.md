# Which human assembly do you use?

We use GRCh38 \(sometimes referred to as hg38\). This is the latest human genome provided by the [Genome Reference Consortium](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc). This is relevant when we display SNPs and other features on the genome. It also affects the set of targets that we use, which is based on the latest Ensembl version at the time of our release. However, because our focus is on evidence associating targets and diseases, we support most evidence data irrespective of the genome assembly that may have been used for their original analysis.
