# What can I search for?

You can search for disease names \(e.g. Alzheimers\), gene names \(e.g. apolipoprotein E\), official gene symbols \(e.g. APOE\), Ensembl gene IDs \(e.g. ENSG00000130203\) or protein symbols \(e.g. P02649\). You may also be able to search for synonyms and abbreviations for both genes \(e.g. apolipoprotein, p94\) and diseases \(e.g. IBD\). You can also search for drugs \(e.g. ADALIMUMAB\) and phenotypes \(hyperlordosis\), which will get matched to their associated diseases and targets.
