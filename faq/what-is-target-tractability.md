# What is target tractability or druggability?

Tractability \(also known as druggability\) of a target is the confidence that we can identify a modulator that interacts with the target to elicit a desired biological effect. 

Our definition is derived from [Ligandability of Drug Targets: Assessment of Chemical Tractability via Experimental and In Silico Approaches](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9783527677047.ch03).

Head to our [target tractability](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/getting-started/target-tractability) page to learn how to explore this data in the profile page of a target, such as [APP](https://www.targetvalidation.org/target/ENSG00000142192?view=sec:tractability), or in the associations page of a disease, such as [Alzheimer's](https://www.targetvalidation.org/disease/EFO_0000249/associations?view=t:priority&fcts=datatype:genetic_association;somatic_mutation;known_drug;affected_pathway), under the Prioritisation view.

Our method to assess target tractability is based on a modified version of [Approaches to target tractability assessment â€“ a practical perspective](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2018/md/c7md00633k#!divAbstract).

Target tractability, druggability, ligandability and target quality can sometimes be used interchangeably as some researchers may give similar definition to these terms.
