# Do I need a license to use third-party data available in the Open Targets Platform?

The Open Targets Platform is open access and open source, but some of its underlying data \(or methods\) may need a license for commercial use. More details on our [terms of use](https://www.targetvalidation.org/terms-of-use).  

If in doubt, we recommend you to contact the data source directly.

If you are interested in using the [Cancer Gene Census](https://docs.targetvalidation.org/data-sources/somatic-mutations#cancer-gene-census) for commercial use, for example, the data in the Open Targets Platform is free to use as it's under Open Targets licence. However, the same data on the COSMIC page is covered by the COSMIC licence. Check [COSMIC licensing](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/license) for more details.
